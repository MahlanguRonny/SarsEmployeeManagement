# SarsEmployeeManagement
Create a new login user on your localhost, username: Sars_User, password: P@ssw0rd@1
Open the NPM console and run the <update-database> command
Note: you can use database username and password of your choice, however you will have to change the connection string in the appsettings.json file
open the angular front-ui app and open the cmd tool
run the command ng serve and in theory all should be well.
